This web application help to organize Google photos into albums. It shows your photos as a tranditional photos gallery but show, on each photos, which albums contain this photo.

Unfortunatly, as Google Photo Library only permits to access album into read only mode, you'll have to open Google Photos to add or remove a photo to an album.

Application avaiblable at http://gorsini.free.fr/google-album-selector/
